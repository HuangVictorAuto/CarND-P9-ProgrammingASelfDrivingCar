## Traffic Light Detection and Classification: Classifier Testing Results

Results summary of Traffic Light Detection and Classification classifier performance on test images:
- In most cases, output of the classifier matches that of the ground truth values
- Misclassifications are in instances where the distance between the car and the traffic light is quite significant. Even, in those instances "Red" and "Yellow" light states are being classified correctly. Missclassifications occurs only with the "Green" light state being classified as "Yellow"
- All the classifier results on test images cab be accessed at this [Link](./CImages_Test/)
