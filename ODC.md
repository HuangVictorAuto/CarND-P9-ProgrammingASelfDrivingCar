## Object Detection and Classification: Traffic Light Detection and Classification

Overview

Discussion and details about the Object Detection and Classification performed as part of the Capstone Project: Programming A Self Driving Car.

As the car traverses along the test track inside the simulator, using images from the front camera, it has to detect traffic lights and classify the light state of the detected traffic light. Depending on the light state of the traffic light, the car stops at the traffic light stop line if it is "Red" or moves forward if it is either "Green or Yellow".
